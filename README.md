## User Experience

    AS A social enthusiast
    I WANT an app that allows me to search within the radius of a city and find ambient conditions and types of activities that are appropriate for those conditions.
    SO THAT social enthusiasts can meet up locally and be present at activities together.


## Use Cases

    WHEN I open the app 
    THEN I am presented with a well-polished layout including a search form. 

    WHEN I look at the search form 
    THEN I can enter a city name and select my intent (shopping, eating, or recreation). I can click a submit button. 

    WHEN I want to choose my search radius 
    THEN I find a submit button that accesses user coordinates to make a search for places nearby.  

    WHEN I click the submit button 
    THEN the app loads local weather, time, and activities. These activities are appropriate to the weather and time conditions, the user intent, and the geographical coordinates of the city or user. 

    WHEN I look at the results 
    THEN the layout is well-polished and resembles the image in the mockup.
